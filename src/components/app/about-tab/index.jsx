      This site is a collection of generative music pieces which can be listened
      to. The term &quot;generative music&quot; has been used especially by
      Brian Eno to describe music which changes continuously and is created by a
      system. Such systems often generate music for as long as one is willing to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pieces featured on this site are not recordings. The music is
      generated by a different system created for each piece. These systems have
      been designed such that each performance is unique and plays continuously
      without repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not a requirement of generative music, most of the pieces featured
      are quite minimal and ambient. Here &quot;ambient&quot; means the music is
      intended to enhance one&apos;s environment but not demand attention. The
      music can be played as a background element without interrupting or
      obscuring other sonic aspects of the environment.
